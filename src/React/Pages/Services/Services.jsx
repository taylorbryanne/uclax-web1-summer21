            <p> We know how important your wedding day is. Thatâ€™s why we work closely with you to custom design a cake that reflects your sentiments, style and vision. After filling out our contact form, we will arrange a consultation and tasting. For couples wanting a less traditional approach or wanting to offer their guests additional desserts, we can create custom dessert tables filled with a variety of unique choices including our signature mini layer cakes.</p>
